DAI2000
=======

This project contains the C programs I developed / read back at my student days. Not useful at all
but worth keeping them just to remember my first steps as a programmer ;)

Code inside `src/c/dai2000` contains programs not developed by me. All code outside `dai2000` was
made by me *looooong* time ago.

A lot of trivial programs are kept just for nostalgy.

TODO
----
* Write a `makefile`
* Sort out the `src/c/dai2000` C files
* Clean duplicated programs
